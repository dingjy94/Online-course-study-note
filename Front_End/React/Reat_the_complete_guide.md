## Redux

Redux is not a part of React.

Reducer must be the only place control state. Put logic in reducer.

### Leaner Reducer
#### Utlity function
This is just a good practice.
Create an update functoin in sepearate file to reuse:

```Javascript
// utility.js

export const updateObject = (oldObject, updateValues) => {
  return {
    ...oldObject,
    ...updatedValues
  }
}

// in reducer
switch(action.type) {
  case Some action type:
    updateObject(state, {prop: state.prop})
}
```
#### Leaner Switch
Extract the `case some case: do something`, `do something` part to a sepearte function.
